# UX220-Lab-1
## Introduction
Hello, my name is Sabrina Ho. I am currently a second-year student who had previously majored in Business Technology Management, but switched to a major in the User Experience Design program with a BTM minor. If I continued in BTM, I would be in my third year. I'm really excited to explore this new program and learn new things while exploring more of my creative sides rather than my business side.

## Things I have Written
When I was in high school, I had written a paper about the negative effects that the construction of the oil pipeline would bring to the environment and economy. I had received around a 95 for the paper. I think I fairly enjoy essay writing on topics that interest me, which is why I chose to share this as one of my favourites. I think the freedom to choose what to write in high school really helped me explore that.
